Designed a program which allows the user to calculate the number of prime numbers in a given interval while specifying the number of threads they want to use.

# What I Learned

* Used C programming language to build application using Xcode
* Used multithreaded programming to divide calculations up between CPU cores and increase program runtime
* Worked with atomic datatype to handle race condition
